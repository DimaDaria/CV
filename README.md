The "Personal Responsive CV/Resume Website" is a project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a modern, responsive website showcasing a comprehensive curriculum vitae or resume. This project was conceived with the aim of providing a dynamic and interactive platform for presenting professional information that may not be adequately represented in traditional paper formats. By leveraging web technologies, the project ensures that essential details such as GitHub repositories, LinkedIn profile links, and other digital assets are easily accessible and seamlessly integrated into the user experience.
